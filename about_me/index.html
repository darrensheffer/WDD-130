    <img alt="self_photo" src="images/self_photo.jpg">
    <h2>Name: Darren Sheffer</h2>
    <h2>Nick-name: "Redacted"</h2>
    <p>    I was born and raised in Utah and something interesting about me is that
        I have been to every state in the United States besides Hawaii.  For my education,
        I initually planned on going into Psychology, but decided to work wih computer
        brains instead of human ones.</p>
    <p>    I was lucky to be born into a family who was active in the church, so I have
        been a member my whole life.  On the Sheffer side, my grandfather had 8 children, 48
        grandchildren, and 118 great grandchildren.  We had yearly family reunions and it was
        always a party!</p>
